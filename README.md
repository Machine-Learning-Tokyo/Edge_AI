# MLT Edge AI
We are excited to kick off our first Embedded ML workshop - a combination of presentation and ideathon.
https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/

Firstly, we will talk about the promise of light-weight deep neural networks for energy-efficient and low-cost IoT applications. We discuss some examples of accelerated and low-memory version of deep learning models for real-time use, predictive maintenance, time-series analysis, and demand forecast. We focus on AI methods for turning IoT data into insights and actions.

After the introductory talk about Edge AI we will build teams of 3-5 people and have 1.5 hours to come up with project ideas for embedded ML scenarios that include use case, feasibility assessment, workflow, allocation of resources (human, time, computation, ...).
